## Mutation Information

- <AaMut mut="S:Y453F"/> has appeared multiple times independently: each can be associated with different accompanying mutations

### S:Y453F
This mutation is in the receptor binding domain (RDB), important to ACE2 binding and antibody recognition


It is associated with the 'cluster 5' "mink" variant that led to some alarm in Denmark in autumn 2020.
This variant has the following additional spike mutations: a deletion at positions 69 and 70 (<AaMut mut="S:H69-"/>, <AaMut mut="S:V70-"/>), as well as <AaMut mut="S:I692V"/> and <AaMut mut="S:M1229I"/>

<AaMut mut="S:Y453F"/> has also been seen previously in mink in the Netherlands (<LinkExternal href="https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/netherlands?c=gt-S_453&f_country=Netherlands&f_host=Mink">example Nextstrain build</LinkExternal>). <br/><br/>

<AaMut mut="S:Y453F"/>: <br/>

- May be a mink-specific adaptation, increasing binding to mink ACE2: ([Rodrigues et al. PloS Comp Bio](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008449) and [Welkers et al. Virus Evolution](https://academic.oup.com/ve/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ve/veaa094/6025194?searchresult=1)); and appearing multiple - times ([van Dorp et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.16.384743v1)).
- May also increase ACE2 binding in humans: [Bloom Lab ACE2 binding website](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/).
- Confirs resistance to an antibody in the Regeneron cocktail: REGN10933 ([Baum et al. Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6506/1014/tab-pdf); [Starr et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.405472v1.full)).
